*************************************************This is the Lava Wall Instruction Manual**********************************
Intro: The Lava wall is a tool that will chase players once activated. The wall itself will have two main peices. It will have the wall itself, as well as the 
lava wall background that represents the lava that will fill in behind the wall. This background wall will be given to us by the modeling team, which will be 
a mesh that is activated as the lava wall travels. 

To Get Started-
	1.Create WallController-
		a. Create an empty gameobject
		b. Add the TestingLava script to it. 

	2. Add Lava Wall-
		a. Create an empty GameObject.
		b. Add the mesh we are using for the lava wall (ideally as a child object)(this wall should be straight up and down)
			i. Note: the wall will be snapped to the start location when the wall is activated, so you don't need it to be at the start
				of the lava wall path, feel free to put it anywhere, if you want it to spawn in or activate dynamically, feel free
				to request this from a programmer
		c. on your lava wall controller object, set the "MyLavaWall" component to the lava wall

	3. Add Lava wall points
		a. Create an emtpy gameobject under the wall controller named "Targets"
		b. Place the sliced background mesh as a child of this object, it should already be the proper size for the level
		c. each section of the slice mesh needs to have a Lava Chunk component attached to it. 
			i. If you want the lava chunk to be a checkpoint, tick the "is checkpoint", this will be where the lava wall is reset to
			when the player dies, that way the wall is not in front of the player when they respawn
	4. Catch up points
		a. We can snap the lava wall forward if the player gets too far ahead. 
		b. To set a lava wall catch up point, go to a checkpoint that you want to trigger the lava wall catch up
		c. in the lava wall catch up drag a lava chunk into the "Snap To This Lava" parameter
			i. This is where the lava wall will snap forward to when the player passes through it
				*Note: this will also set the lava check point to this location, if you don't want it to have this behavior, let us know
